Basic EDA on a data set just to get back into practice 
# Movie Dataset Explorer

A foundational data analysis project exploring the IMDb movies dataset to practice core data cleaning and manipulation skills with Python and Pandas.

## About The Project

This project is a hands-on exercise in the fundamental workflow of a data analyst. The goal was to take a raw dataset, inspect it for errors and inconsistencies, perform necessary data cleaning and type conversions, and then answer several analytical questions.

This project demonstrates proficiency in:
* Loading and inspecting data with Pandas.
* Cleaning and transforming data (e.g., converting text columns like 'Runtime' and 'Gross' to numeric types).
* Filtering, sorting, and aggregating data to answer specific questions.

## Skills Showcased

* **Python**
* **Pandas**
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **Data Cleaning**
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

## Key Findings

* The highest-rated movie in the dataset is "The Shawshank Redemption."
* The movie with the longest runtime is "Gangs of Wasseypur."
* The analysis of the 'Gross' income column revealed that "Avatar" had the highest earnings in this dataset.
